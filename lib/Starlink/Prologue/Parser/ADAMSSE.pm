=head1 NAME

Starlink::Prologue::Parser::ADAMSSE - Old ADAM/SSE prologue parser

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Starlink::Prologue::Parser::ADAMSSE;

  $p = new Starlink::Prologue::Parser::ADAMSSE();

  for my $l (@lines) {
    my $status = $p->push_line( $l );
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is responsible for parsing source code and creating
C<Starlink::Prologue> objects.  It only knows how to parse old-style
ADAM/SSE prologues.

=item B<push_line>

Add a new line of content to the parser. Since some prologues are only
terminated when the first line of code is discovered, it is sometimes
necessary to return both a line of code and the relevant
C<Starlink::Prologue> prologue object. The C<push_line> method returns
the line itself if the line is not part of a prologue, and/or a
prologue object if the prologue is terminated by this line.

  ($line, $prologue) = $parser->push_line( $input );

The returned line will not have a newline.

    # - Terminator section, eg. Type Definitions :

    # The complication is that the *- completes the
    # variable definition section but the prologue that
    # interests Starlink::Prologue does not include variable
    # definitions.

    # Real code can not be a terminator since the ADAM/SSE
    # style has the SUBROUTINE call embedded in it. We should
    # fill in "Type of Module" by using the SUBROUTINE vs FUNCTION
    # vs BLOCK DATA.

=item B<prolog_start>

Returns true if the line supplied could be interpreted as a
start of a prolog. Otherwise returns false.

 $is_start = $p->prolog_start( $line );

In list context returns the comment character (usually a '*'),
the name of the routine and the purpose (which should all be on a
single line).
